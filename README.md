## 🚀 Project Overview

This project is a powerful Python-based tool that bridges the gap between natural language and SQL queries. By leveraging the capabilities of LLMA3.1 (Large Language Model) and LangChain's SQL agent, it allows users to interact with a MySQL database using plain English questions through a simple command-line interface.

## 🌟 Key Features

- 🗣️ Natural language processing of database queries
- 🤖 Utilizes locally hosted LLMA3.1 model
- 🔗 Implements LangChain's SQL agent for efficient query generation
- 🎯 Seamless integration with MySQL database
- 💬 Human-like responses to database inquiries

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language
- **LLMA3.1**: Large Language Model for natural language understanding
- **LangChain**: Framework for developing applications with LLMs
- **MySQL**: Relational database management system

## 🔧 Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/natural-language-to-sql.git](https://github.com/seotanvirbd/Simple-Langchain-SQL-Agent.git)
   cd natural-language-to-sql
   ```

2. Install required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up your MySQL database and update the connection details in `config.py`.

4. Ensure LLMA3.1 is properly set up and accessible locally.

5. Run the script:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

## 🖥️ Usage

Once the script is running, simply type your questions about the database in natural language at the prompt. The tool will process your query, generate the appropriate SQL, execute it, and return the results in a conversational manner.

Example:
```
> What are the top 5 selling products?
Based on our sales data, the top 5 selling products are:
1. Widget X
2. Gadget Y
3. Tool Z
4. Accessory A
5. Component B
These products have consistently shown high sales volumes over the past quarter.
```
